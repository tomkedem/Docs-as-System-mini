# Human Operational Policy mini  
A policy document describing how the human leads the development process  
Approves tasks  
Maintains professional direction  
And supervises the agent’s work in a stable and predictable way

Actual file location

Created by  
Human

Approved by  
A senior technical authority

## Purpose of the Document  
To define how the human manages and oversees development processes together with the agent  
The goal is not to complicate the workflow, but to create a clear framework that ensures correct  
Professional  
And consistent execution  
Without surprises

The human maintains system stability  
Ensures that every action is validated and accurate  
And prevents the agent from performing changes that are not part of the defined step

---

## The Human’s Role in the System  
The human is responsible for  
● Understanding the broader context  
● Making professional decisions  
● Ensuring alignment with all documents  
● Selecting which steps will be executed  
● Guiding the agent whenever there is uncertainty  
● Approving every task performed by the agent  
● Merging code into important branches  
● Documenting significant decisions

The agent executes  
The human directs  
Together they operate as one integrated system

---

## Responsibility Over Documentation  
The human is responsible for keeping the following documents up to date  
● Business Requirements mini  
● Project Specification mini  
● Architecture Blueprint mini  
● Implementation Plan mini  
● Agent Configuration mini yaml

If the documents are not updated  
The agent may perform incorrect actions  
Therefore the human must keep them accurate and current

---

## How the Human Reviews a Task  
Task review is not checking a single line of code  
It is a logical review against the overall plan

The human checks  
● Whether the code matches the logical specification  
● Whether the change aligns with the blueprint  
● Whether the task is completed according to plan  
● Whether all tests passed  
● Whether a log entry was created  
● Whether there is any unexpected deviation

The human approves only after a full and clear review

---

## How the Human Corrects Agent Behavior  
In case of deviation  
The human must be clear  
Focused  
And ensure the issue does not repeat

The human  
● Points to the exact document section that was not followed  
● Explains what should have happened  
● Redefines the task if needed  
● Approves restarting the action

The human establishes clear boundaries for the agent

---

## Human Responsibility for Git  
The human has exclusive authority over actions that alter history or branch structure  
The agent works only under predefined permissions

The human is responsible for  
● Creating strategic branches  
● Merging code into important branches  
● Handling conflicts  
● Version management  
● Full review of changes before any merge  
● Defining a stable and clear branch structure

The agent may work only in branches intended for regular development  
The human maintains order  
The agent performs the technical work only

---

## Managing Progress Throughout the Project  
The human is responsible for managing progress according to the development plan  
Selecting the next step  
Marking completed steps  
And ensuring the agent does not jump between tasks

The human  
● Selects a step from the plan  
● Approves starting the step  
● Reviews tasks executed by the agent  
● Ensures the implementation log is complete and accurate  
● Decides when it is time to move to the next stage

The human prevents uncontrolled advancement  
And ensures a proper development pace

---

## Working in a Team  
When multiple developers work together  
The human is the one who maintains the full picture  
And coordinates between developers and the agent

The human  
● Distributes tasks among developers  
● Maintains consistency between different parts of the system  
● Ensures tasks do not interfere with each other  
● Handles dependencies between steps  
● Guides the agent in sensitive areas

The agent follows a predictable pattern  
Developers follow assigned tasks  
And the human ensures everything aligns toward one clear direction

---

## Closing a Stage  
A stage is considered complete only after the human confirms everything was properly finished

The human checks  
● That all tasks in the stage are marked as complete  
● That all tests passed  
● That there are no undocumented deviations  
● That all files were updated according to the documents  
● That all log entries were written  
● That the Pull Request is ready for review

The human is the authority that closes the stage  
The agent does not close stages independently

---

## Behavior in Case of Uncertainty  
When the agent returns a result that is unclear  
The human must pause and provide full guidance

The human  
● Clarifies the task  
● Removes ambiguity  
● Updates a document if necessary  
● Approves restarting the task  
● Prevents unintended progress

The human ensures the agent does not guess  
And does not fix issues beyond what was defined

---

## Summary  
The Human Operational Policy mini defines how the human operates within the development system  
The human sets the pace  
The direction  
The professional standard  
And the stability of the system

The document ensures  
● Organized work  
● Professional accuracy  
● Full oversight over the agent  
● Proper division of tasks  
● Consistent documentation  
● Safe development

The human and the agent work together  
With the human leading  
And the agent executing  
Within a clear framework that supports reliable and consistent development
