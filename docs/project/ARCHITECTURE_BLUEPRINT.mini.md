# Architecture Blueprint  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

A technical architecture document that defines the structure of the system,  
its main components, the core flows, and the boundaries of responsibility.  
This document serves as the technical foundation for all development stages  
and enables the agent to operate safely without inventing structural patterns.

## Purpose of this Document  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

To clearly describe the technical structure of the system.  
This document answers two primary questions:

• How the system is built  
• How the system’s components interact with each other  

It does not explain how to write code.  
It defines the structural blueprint that all code must follow.

---

## System Overview  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

A high-level overview of the system’s parts.  
No technology lists, no languages, no databases.  
Just a conceptual description of what exists in the system.

Common components include:  
• Intake Component  
• Processing Component  
• Presentation Component  
• Internal Services  
• Data Source  
• External Systems  
• Execution Agent  

Each component has a clear, isolated responsibility  
and does not perform tasks outside its domain.

---

## Responsibility Allocation Between Components  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

Every component receives a well-defined responsibility domain  
to prevent overlap and confusion.

General examples  
• The Intake Component is responsible for receiving data  
  from external sources  
• The Processing Component handles logical validation  
  and business processing  
• The Presentation Component exposes information to users  
• Internal Services coordinate background processes  
• The Execution Agent performs predefined actions  
  that do not require human judgment  

The goal is to guarantee clarity and separation of concerns.

---

## Core Data Flow  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

The blueprint must present the system’s primary data flow  
in a simple, technology-agnostic way.

The flow typically includes:  
1. An external source sends a piece of data  
2. The Intake Component receives it  
3. A basic logical validation is performed  
4. The data is forwarded to the Processing Component  
5. Business logic is executed  
6. The system produces a structured outcome  
7. The appropriate component displays or returns it  

In case of failure:  
• An exception entry is created  
• The process does not continue  
• The system remains stable and other flows are not affected

---

## System Components  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

This section describes the major components of the system.  
The explanation is conceptual, not technological.  
The purpose is to define a structure that can be implemented  
in any language or platform.

Possible components:  
• Intake Component  
• Processing Component  
• Presentation Component  
• Internal Messaging Handler  
• Monitoring / Observability Unit  
• Data Source  
• System Configuration Layer  
• Execution Agent  

Each component must have one clear responsibility only.  
This separation prevents overlap and keeps the system predictable.

---

## Component Responsibilities  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

Each component is described so that both the developer  
and the agent understand what is allowed and what is forbidden.

General examples  

**Intake Component**  
• Receives data from an external source  
• Does not perform business logic  
• Performs basic validation only  
• Forwards the data to the Processing Component  

**Processing Component**  
• Handles all business logic  
• Receives data from the Intake Component  
• Produces a deterministic outcome for every scenario  
• Does not communicate directly with the user interface  

**Presentation Component**  
• Displays information  
• Transforms data into user-friendly output  
• Does not store information  
• Does not perform business logic  

**Internal Service**  
• Handles internal state and coordination  
• Assists the Processing Component in complex flows  
• Not exposed to end users  

**Execution Agent**  
• Performs only predefined actions  
• Never operates without a guiding document  
• Logs every action to the system log  

---

## Responsibility Boundaries  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

Defining boundaries is a critical part of the blueprint.  
It prevents shortcuts, mixing responsibilities,  
and silent coupling between unrelated parts.

General examples  
• The Presentation Component must not handle raw data  
• The Processing Component must not access UI elements  
• The Intake Component must not create business logic  
• The Agent must not perform any action not defined  
  in the system documents  

These boundaries are essential, especially when the agent  
is part of the development workflow and must not invent structure.

---

## Component Dependencies  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

This section describes how each component depends on others.  
This is not about technologies, protocols, or frameworks —  
only the logical dependency model.

Possible dependencies:  
• The Intake Component depends on an external data source  
• The Processing Component depends on an Internal Service  
• The Presentation Component depends on processed results  
• Internal Services depend on configuration inputs  
• The Execution Agent depends on all project documents  

When a dependency fails:  
• The system reports an exception  
• The process does not continue  
• Stability is preserved even if one component fails  

---

## Architectural Rules That Must Not Be Violated  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

These rules define the core stability, consistency,  
and technical identity of the system.

Fundamental rules:  
• Every piece of data follows one clear, defined path  
• No skipping components in the flow  
• Every meaningful change is logged  
• No new entity or process may be introduced  
  without updating the documents  
• Every process must remain consistent across cycles  

These rules enforce a rigid backbone  
the agent must always respect.

---

## System Level Data Structure  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

This section describes how the system conceptually stores,  
processes, and exposes information.  
It does not define any database or technical schema,  
only the logical structure.

The structure includes:  
• What the source of truth is  
• Which logical entities exist  
• Which entities are created at runtime  
• Which data must remain consistent  
• Which data may be temporary  

General example  
• Data arrives through the Intake Component  
• A logical object is created  
• Business logic is applied  
• A structured result is sent to the Presentation Component  

The agent uses this layer to maintain consistency.

---

## Timing Management  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

This part describes how the system handles timing,  
a critical aspect in most real-world systems.

Timing includes:  
• How long a process is allowed to run  
• What happens if data arrives late  
• What happens if data arrives too early  
• Required update frequency  
• Actions that must occur in a strict order  

General examples  
• Significantly late data enters a special validation flow  
• A process must finish before the next begins  
• Operational reports must arrive at predefined intervals  
  to maintain consistency  

---

## System Events  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

Events are a central part of any stable system.  
They define predictable behavior and enable structured flows.

This section describes:  
• Which events exist  
• What triggers each event  
• What happens during the event  
• The expected result  
• What the system does when an event is abnormal  

General example  
**Event: New Data Arrived**  
• The Intake Component receives the information  
• A validation step is performed  
• A request is sent to the Processing Component  
• A structured result is produced  
• The Presentation Component displays the information  

If an exception appears:  
• The event is marked  
• The process stops  
• Human intervention may be required  

---

## Integrations with External Systems  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

Every real system interacts with external sources at some point.  
This section defines those interactions at a *logical* level only.

The integration description includes:  
• Which external system is involved  
• What information the system receives  
• What information it returns  
• Conditions required before the integration runs  
• What happens if the external source is unavailable  
• How the system handles duplicate or inconsistent inputs  

Key principle  
The integration must be safe.  
It must never destabilize the internal system.  
Any deviation must be logged clearly.

---

## System Consistency  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

One of the most important architectural principles.  
The system must remain logically consistent at all times.

Consistency requirements:  
• Data remains reliable throughout the entire flow  
• No two components interpret information differently  
• Every screen presents the same truth  
• Repeated processes produce identical results  

The agent relies on this consistency  
to perform accurate self-checks before writing code.

---

## Core Architectural Principles  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

These principles define the character of the system  
and the way it should behave from a technical perspective.  
They are technology-independent and ensure long-term stability.

Main principles:  
• The system is modular, and each component has a single responsibility  
• Data flows through one well-defined path with no shortcuts  
• Every meaningful action creates a clear log entry  
• Failures do not crash the system — they are handled gracefully  
• The system supports self-checking at every stage  

These principles ensure the system remains stable  
even years after its initial development.

---

## Non-Negotiable Rules  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

This section is crucial because it defines the reset lines of the architecture.  
Both developers and the agent must follow these rules.

Mandatory rules:  
• The Presentation Component must not access data sources directly  
• The Processing Component must not trigger UI actions  
• Raw data must not be shown to users  
• Components must not bypass each other  
• No new entity, process, or logical flow may be added  
  without updating the system documents  

These rules ensure long-term architectural stability  
even when the team changes.

---

## Reliability and Continuous Operation  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

This section defines how the system behaves  
under load, partial failures, or unexpected conditions.  
It describes behavior — not technical SLAs.

Key topics:  
• How the system handles high load  
• How invalid or suspicious data is detected  
• What happens if a component is unavailable  
• Whether some processes can continue in partial mode  
• How the system recovers to a stable state  

Clear definitions here help the agent  
perform correct validations before making any code changes.

---

## Exception Handling  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

Every system must manage exceptions  
in a structured and predictable way  
to maintain stability and trust.

Exception handling includes:  
• Detecting the exception  
• Stopping the relevant process  
• Writing a detailed log entry  
• Passing information for human review or UI display  
• Creating a recovery path when possible  

Strong exception handling directly impacts system quality.

---

## Updating the System Structure  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

The system is not static.  
This section explains how structural changes must be performed safely.

Every update must include:  
• Updating the logical specification  
• Updating the Blueprint  
• Updating the Implementation Plan  
• Ensuring the agent understands the change  
  and does not remain aligned to an outdated structure  
• Full testing before any merge  

The update flow prevents ad-hoc changes  
that might break existing processes.

---

## Development Cycles  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

The blueprint describes how the system progresses  
across different development stages.

A development cycle includes:  
• Planning according to the Blueprint  
• Writing code in defined steps  
• Agent performing self-checks  
• Opening a human approval request  
• Merging only after validation  

A clear cycle allows the agent  
to move between stages with no ambiguity.

---

## Summary  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

The Architecture Blueprint mini defines the system’s structure  
and its technical behavior at a language-agnostic level.  
It bridges the gap between the logical specification  
and the implementation plan,  
providing clear guidance for both developers and the agent.

The document completes the three foundational components  
of the Docs-as-System mini methodology:  
• Business Requirements mini  
• Project Specification mini  
• Architecture Blueprint mini  

Together, these documents define the essence of the system  
and ensure development remains professional, stable, consistent,  
and safe for both humans and agents.

This document is editable and evolves with the project.  
Headings must remain unchanged for validation.  
All example content should be replaced  
with the real architectural details of your system.
