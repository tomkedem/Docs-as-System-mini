# Prepare Step

## Purpose  
Identify the active step inside the Implementation Plan,  
understand its tasks,  
and verify that the step is ready for execution before any work begins.

## Relevant Files  
• docs/project/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.mini.md  
• docs/project/PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.mini.md  
• docs/project/ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT.mini.md  

## Instructions  

Read the file IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.mini.md  
Find the step marked as the active step  
Verify that the step contains well defined tasks  

For each task in the step:  
• Read the task name  
• Read the task objective  
• Check dependencies between tasks if any exist  

Verify for each task:  
• It aligns with PROJECT_SPEC  
• It aligns with ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT  
• It matches the business requirements  

Check if any task:  
• Requires human approval  
• Impacts sensitive areas  
• Impacts multiple components simultaneously  

Identify if any tasks are missing critical information:  
• Tasks without a clear outcome  
• Tasks without a defined purpose  
• Tasks not belonging to a coherent plan  

If any uncertainty is found:  
Stop  
Summarize your current understanding  
Ask the human for guidance  

## Continuation Conditions  
• The active step is clearly identified  
• All tasks inside the step are understood  
• No contradictions exist between the step and the system documents  
• No missing information  
• The step is ready for execution  

## Expected Output  
• A complete structured picture of the step  
• A list of tasks inside the step  
• Identification of dependencies  
• Understanding whether work can begin or additional clarification is required
