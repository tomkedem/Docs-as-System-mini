# Update Development Log

## Purpose
Create a new log entry inside the live implementation log file,  
following the exact structure defined in the official log template.

## Relevant Files
Log entry template:  
`docs/project/templates/log/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG_TEMPLATE.mini.md`

Live implementation log:  
`docs/logs/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.mini.md`

## Instructions

### 1. Read the log entry template  
Open:  
`docs/project/templates/log/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG_TEMPLATE.mini.md`

Identify clearly:
- The required fields  
- The exact field order  
- Date/time format  
- Summary format  
- Allowed status values  

### 2. Read the live log file  
Open:  
`docs/logs/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.mini.md`

Rules:
- Do not modify existing entries  
- Do not delete entries  
- Do not change header structure if present  
- Never reorder or rewrite the log  

### 3. Build a new log entry  
The new entry must follow the template exactly.  
Populate the fields based on the task that was just completed.

Each entry must include:
- dateTime  
- actor  
- stepName  
- taskName  
- filesChanged  
- summary (short and clear)  
- testsSummary  
- reviewStatus  

Notes:
- Use English only  
- Do not add extra fields  
- Do not change the order of fields  

### 4. Append the entry  
Add the new log entry **at the bottom of the file**.  
Preserve spacing and formatting used in previous entries.

## Continuation Conditions
- The new entry matches the template exactly  
- All required fields exist and are filled  
- No existing entries were changed  
- The log file remains valid and readable  

## Expected Output
A new log entry added to:  
`docs/logs/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.mini.md`  
Fully aligned with the official structure defined in:  
`docs/project/templates/log/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG_TEMPLATE.mini.md`
