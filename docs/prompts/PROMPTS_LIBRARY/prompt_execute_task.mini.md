# Execute Task

## Purpose  
Execute the current task accurately,  
in full alignment with the system documents,  
and according to the development rules defined by the methodology.

## Instructions  

1. Read the task from the Implementation Plan.  
2. Identify all required inputs for the task.  
3. Check which files are allowed for editing.  
4. Verify which files are forbidden to edit.  
5. Read all relevant definitions from the project documents.  
6. Apply the smallest required change to complete the task.  
7. Maintain consistency with every system document.  
8. Avoid changes that are not part of the task.  
9. Perform refactoring only if explicitly defined in the task.  
10. Add new unit tests if the task requires it.  
11. Update existing unit tests only if required by the logic change.

## Completion Conditions  

The task is considered complete only if:

• The task requirements were fully implemented  
• No deviation from the system documents occurred  
• All tests passed successfully  
• No unnecessary changes were made to files outside the defined task scope  

## Expected Output  

• A precise code change that fulfills the task definition  
• Valid and passing tests  
• Updated files limited strictly to the task’s scope
