## Purpose of this Document  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

To define the logical behavior of the system in a clear and accurate way.  
This is a bridge document that translates business logic  
into practical definitions that allow a smooth transition  
into the technical planning stage.

The document focuses on what the system does  
rather than how it does it.

---

## System Actors  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

A list of entities that interact with the system on a logical level.

• Primary human user  
• Secondary user  
• A system that provides incoming data  
• A system that receives data from us  
• The agent that performs actions inside the system

Each actor is described briefly  
to clarify its role and influence on the processes.

---

## Actor Goals  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

The motivation that drives each actor to perform actions in the system.

General examples only  
• An operational user wants a clear view and the ability to update information  
• An external system sends information for synchronization  
• Another system requests data to continue its own process  
• The agent carries out tasks defined for it in the development plan

---

## Main Use Cases  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

Use cases describe what each actor does inside the system.  
There is no technology here and no code structure.  
Only pure logical flow.

Every use case should define:  
• What triggers the process  
• What the actor is trying to achieve  
• What the system does in response  
• What the successful outcome looks like  
• What happens in case of failure  

These use cases form the bridge  
between the business definition  
and the technical architecture.

---

### First Use Case  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

Use case name  
A short description of what happens  
and who performs the action

**Goal**  
The actor wants to perform a specific action  
and receive a clear result

**Flow**  
1. The actor performs the initial action  
2. The system evaluates logical conditions  
3. The system produces a result or information  
4. The system displays the result  
   or forwards it to another component

**Successful Outcomes**  
• Information is displayed correctly  
• The action completes without errors  

**Failure Outcomes**  
• The input is invalid  
• The system cannot complete the action  
• An external data source is unavailable  

---

### Additional Use Case  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

Use case name  
Describe what is blocking the user  
and what action they expect to perform

**Goal**  
Provide a consistent and clear outcome

**Flow**  
1. The system receives data or a user action  
2. The data is validated  
3. The system processes the request  
4. The system returns a result  
   either to logic or to the user interface

**Successful Outcomes**  
• Information is updated in the system  
• The system reports success  

**Failure Outcomes**  
• Information arrived twice  
• The data does not match existing records  
• An action is blocked because a prerequisite was not met  

---

### Creating Additional Use Cases  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

Every project includes a different number of use cases.  
Sometimes three, sometimes twenty.  
It depends on the system  
and the level of complexity.

Each use case must be:  
• Concise  
• Clear  
• Connected to specific actors  
• Consistent in structure

---

## Overall Logical Flow  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

A description of the general sequence of operations  
that occur in the system,  
independent of any specific use case.

The flow describes:  
• How data enters the system  
• Who handles it first  
• What happens to it along the way  
• How the system responds  
• Which processes must remain consistent  

**General description**  
1. An external source provides a new piece of data  
2. The system receives the data and validates it  
3. The system processes it according to the rules  
4. The system produces a result or internal action  
5. The system displays information  
   or continues a background process  

**In case of failure**  
• The system records an exception  
• The system blocks progression to the next stage  
• Human intervention or reprocessing may be required

---

## Logical Events in the System  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

This document must define the main events in the system,  
because events are the foundation of stability.

Important events include:  
• Arrival of new data  
• Change in the state of a process  
• An exceptional event that requires attention  
• Temporary failure in a validation mechanism  
• Successful completion of a process  

Each event includes:  
• A trigger  
• Processing logic  
• A resulting outcome  

---

## Logical Data Structure  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

This document does not define a database schema.  
Instead, it describes the main entities  
at a business and logical level.

Each entity includes:  
• A short description  
• Significant fields  
• Main logical behaviors  
• Logical relationships with other entities  

**General example only**  
Entity name  
• A general description of its role  
• Important fields such as identifier, status, or query fields  
• Relationships such as belonging or dependency  
• Main actions that relate to the process  

The document does not define technical field names.  
It defines only the logical meaning.

---

## Logical Rules  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

Rules that describe how the system behaves in different situations.  
They guide the technical planning that comes later.

A logical rule includes:  
• A triggering condition  
• The action that occurs when the condition is met  
• A note describing what happens when the condition is not met  

**General examples**  
• If a piece of data is received for the second time,  
  an additional check must be performed  
• If a required field is missing,  
  the system marks an exception  
• If a user action does not meet the rules,  
  the system returns an error message  

These rules are the backbone  
of the system’s logical behavior.

---

## Edge Conditions  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

Every system includes situations that are not part of the normal flow.  
They must be defined clearly to avoid surprises.

Common edge conditions:  
• Invalid data  
• Data arriving at the wrong time  
• An event received twice  
• Significant delay between stages  
• An action triggered without proper permission  

For each edge condition define:  
• What the system should do  
• What the system must not do  
• Whether human intervention is required  

---

## Interactions Between Components  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

This document describes the logical interaction  
between components in the system,  
independent of any technical implementation.

A logical interaction includes:  
• Who initiates the action  
• What enters the process  
• What leaves the process  
• What happens in the middle  
  and this is a very important point  
• Which rules apply to the action  

**General example**  
• A user requests to display data  
• The system calls the processing layer  
• A validation check is performed against a data source  
• The information returns and is displayed correctly  

If an exception occurs:  
• The system returns a controlled error message  
• The process does not move to an invalid next step  
• The event is written into the main log  

---

## Logical Consistency  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

The purpose of this section is to ensure that every process,  
every use case, and every rule in the system  
behaves in a unified and predictable way.

Requirements for logical consistency:  
• Every process has a clear beginning and end  
• No process violates the core principles of the system  
• Data remains consistent across all flows  
• The system applies the same logic across all screens and actions  

The agent relies on this consistency  
to perform accurate self checks  
and to avoid unexpected behavior during development.

---

## Success Outcomes  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

This document must define  
what counts as a correct logical outcome in each process.  
Success outcomes are not technical.  
They are logical only.

A correct outcome includes:  
• The system receives valid data  
• Logical validation completes without exceptions  
• The process ends with a result that the user expects  
• Data is updated consistently  
• The system avoids duplicates or logical errors  

This definition forms the basis  
for test planning and technical architecture.

---

## Failure Outcomes  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

Logical failure is defined in advance  
so that the system and the agent  
can handle unexpected situations correctly.

A logical failure includes:  
• The received data does not meet the rules  
• The system cannot complete a process  
  due to a business constraint  
• Incoming data does not match existing information  
• A process ends too early or too late  
• An external data source is unavailable  

In case of failure:  
• The system provides a clear message  
• The action does not move to the next stage  
• Full documentation is written to the log  
• Human intervention may be required  

---

## Timing Considerations  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

Some processes require attention to timing.  
This document describes such timing at a logical level.

Timing rules include:  
• What the system expects to receive  
  and at what frequency  
• Which actions require a specific order  
• What happens when an action arrives late  
• What must occur when an event happens too quickly  

**General example**  
Data arriving faster than expected may cause overload.  
Therefore the system limits logical processing speed.

---

## Logical Integrations with Other Systems  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

This section is a high level description  
that does not include protocols or technical formats.

Integration describes:  
• What information the system receives from another system  
• What information it returns  
• Which conditions must be met before transferring information  
• What happens when the integration fails  
• Who holds the source of truth  

This level of detail is enough  
to guide the future architecture.

---

## System Behavior Principles  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

This document defines general principles  
that the system must not violate.

• The system preserves data consistency  
• The system does not perform actions  
  that are not defined in the use cases  
• Every action must be logically guaranteed  
• Invalid data does not affect valid displays  
• A failed operation never progresses to the next stage  

These principles are mandatory for any technical design.

---

## Logical Flow Diagram  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

This document may include a simple textual or graphical diagram.  
It is not mandatory, but it is highly recommended.

**Textual example**  
A data source sends information  
The system receives the information  
The system checks validity  
The system processes it according to the rules  
The system displays or updates the information  

A diagram helps understand  
the overall picture of the processes.

---

## Preconditions and Postconditions  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

Every process must be fully defined.

**Preconditions**  
• Data exists  
• Data is valid  
• The user has permission  
• The external source is available  

**Postconditions**  
• Data remains in a logical and stable state  
• No unintended effect on other processes  
• The system is ready for the next action  

---

## Decision Based Rules  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

This document also includes rules  
that define how the system chooses a course of action.

**Examples only**  
• If information arrives late,  
  the system treats it differently  
• If duplicates are detected,  
  the system performs additional checks  
• If a required field is missing,  
  the system continues a defined process  
  but does not display partial information  

These rules are important  
for future architectural planning.

---

## Summary  
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS HEADING -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_CONTENT: Replace this entire section with your project specific content, then delete this TEMPLATE_CONTENT line. -->

The Project Specification mini  
defines the full logical behavior of the system.  
It includes use cases, processes, events, rules,  
edge conditions, and definitions  
of both successful and failed outcomes.  

Regardless of the nature of the project,  
this is a mandatory document  
before any form of technical planning begins.

The document serves as the direct foundation  
for writing the Architecture Blueprint mini  
and allows the agent to work  
according to predefined behavior  
without room for interpretation.
